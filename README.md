# Predictive-maintenance-on-MetroPT-Dataset

Predictive maintenance is a proactive approach to reduce the downtime and costs of machine failures by using machine learning techniques to analyze data and predict faults.
We use different machine learning models, such as logistic regression, and decision tree, to train and test our framework on the dataset. We compare the performance of the models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
